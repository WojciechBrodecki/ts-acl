# TS-ACL Technical Documentation

## Overview
TS-ACL is a comprehensive Access Control List library for Node.js applications with first-class TypeScript support and seamless integration with modern frontend frameworks.

## Core Principles

### 1. Type Safety First
- Full TypeScript support throughout the entire stack
- Strict typing for permissions, roles, and resources
- Compile-time validation of ACL rules

### 2. Framework Agnostic Core
- Modular architecture allowing different backend integrations
- Pluggable storage providers (Mongoose, Prisma, etc.)
- Framework-specific adapters for optimal DX

### 3. Performance by Design
- Multi-layer caching strategy
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Lazy loading and batch operations

### 4. Developer Experience
- Intuitive API design
- Comprehensive TypeScript IntelliSense
- Rich debugging and development tools
- Extensive documentation and examples

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Workflow
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Type-First Design**: Define TypeScript interfaces before logic
3. **Documentation-Driven**: Update docs with every feature
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Benchmark critical paths
5. **Security Review**: Regular security audits

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% test coverage
- **Type Coverage**: 100% TypeScript coverage
- **Security**: Regular dependency audits and security reviews
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation with examples

### Release Strategy
- **Semantic Versioning**: Strict adherence to semver
- **Beta Releases**: Feature testing in beta channel
- **LTS Versions**: Long-term support for major versions
- **Migration Guides**: Comprehensive upgrade documentation

## Technical Stack

### Core Dependencies
```json
{
  "mongoose": "^8.x",
  "@types/mongoose": "^5.x",
  "typescript": "^5.x",
  "express": "^4.x",
  "@types/express": "^4.x"
}
```

### Development Dependencies
```json
{
  "jest": "^29.x",
  "@types/jest": "^29.x",
  "ts-jest": "^29.x",
  "eslint": "^8.x",
  "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^6.x",
  "prettier": "^3.x",
  "husky": "^8.x",
  "lint-staged": "^14.x"
}
```

### Optional Dependencies
```json
{
  "redis": "^4.x",        // For caching
  "ioredis": "^5.x",      // Alternative Redis client
  "winston": "^3.x",      // For logging
  "prom-client": "^14.x"  // For metrics
}
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Input Validation
- Strict validation of all user inputs
- Schema-level validation with Mongoose
- SQL injection prevention (even though we use MongoDB)
- XSS protection in web contexts

### 2. Authorization Security
- Fail-secure defaults (deny by default)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular permission audits
- Time-limited tokens and sessions

### 3. Data Protection
- Encrypted sensitive data at rest
- Secure transmission (HTTPS only)
- GDPR compliance for user data
- Regular backup and recovery testing

## Performance Targets

### Response Times
- Permission check: < 10ms (cached)
- Permission check: < 100ms (uncached)
- Role assignment: < 500ms
- Bulk operations: < 2s for 1000 items

### Scalability
- Support for 100k+ users
- 10k+ concurrent permission checks
- Horizontal scaling support
- Database sharding compatibility

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for distributed caching
- In-memory cache for single instances
- Intelligent cache invalidation
- Cache warming strategies

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Permission check latency
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Error rates and types
- Resource usage patterns

### Logging Strategy
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Audit trail for all permission changes
- Performance logging for slow operations
- Security event logging

### Alerting
- High error rates
- Performance degradation
- Security violations
- Cache miss spikes
